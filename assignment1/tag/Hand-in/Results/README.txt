Hi Kelly, Markus, whomever else will be marking this,

This README will explain how to run our code.

1. TSPProblem.java is our driver program.
2. In the main method, toward the bottom you will find four functions relating to our three algorithms plus the Inver-Over algorithm.
3. Comment/Uncomment the ones you wish to run
	- Parameter 1 is the population size
	- Parameter 2 is the number of generations
4. Once completed the best tour will be printed.

At command line, run:

java TSPProblem -f <filename>

Also, we collected a lot of data and include it in the appropriate folders for each algorithm
Each log file contains a set of runs and was output to a .csv file.
Make sure you expand column A to see all the relevant data

Thanking you,
William Reid, Matthew Hart, Samantha Peachey, Alec Bellati.
