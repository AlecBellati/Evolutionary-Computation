\section*{Exercise 2}
This exercise focuses on modifying only the packing of the knapsac - the TSP tour is supplied in a text file that is read-in using the \textit{linkern tour} method provided in the \textit{Optimisation} class. Since this problem revolves around solving the traditional knapsack problem, research into solutions suggested a purely evolutionary approach may yield good results in the appropriate time-frame, however there was little guarantee it would obtain the optimal result. As such, the following solution is evolved from a purely linear approach which I have labelled - Obsessive Packing.
