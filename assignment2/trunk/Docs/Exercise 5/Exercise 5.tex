\section*{Exercise 5}
Each of the algorithms supplied in the previous 3 exercises all approach the problem in completely separate ways, ranging from simple linear searches to evolutionary algorithms base on complex heuristics. With additional time, these algorithms could be evolved to formulate even greater results - however the conclusions drawn from this assignment appear to point towards taking two separate approaches.\\

Using simple linear search methods and intelligent heuristics,  we were able to find a ``close to optimal'' packing of the knapsack. Once found, evolutionary methods are used to find the best TSP for the knapsack provided. An attempt to do this in a similar manner by splitting the problem in half, and optimising one half for a TSP solution and the other for an optimal knapsack solution yielded poor results. Taking the entire solution in two separate stages may yield even greater results.\\

The best algorithm formulated was that of the Obsessive Packing. Its simple implementation finds the best packing of the knapsack, given a particular tour. Our methods also enable the algorithm to first quickly find an optimal tour using methods created in assignment one. This functionality has been turned off for the purposes of this exercise but can be added if desired.

\section{Test Parameters}
The following parameters were found to be close to optimal to achieve good results. Definitions for the categories are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Knapsack Seed:} The algorithm allows for various methods to seed the knapsack. The ``seed'' is the starting packing of the knapsack and can greatly affect the final result. Seed 2 chooses items based on their profit-to-weight ratio, while seed 4 randomly picks items. (Explanations for a total of 6 seeds can be found in the \textit{Will.java} file)
	\item {\bf TSP Choice:} To account for extendibility, this algorithm not only considers just the packing of the knapsack, but may also consider changes to the TSP tour. Choice 1 simply uses the supplied linkern tour, where as choice 2 will use our best TSP algorithm from assignment 1.
	\item {\bf Generations:} Number of times to perform the algorithm on the knapsack (knapsack packing is retained for the next generation, it is not re-seeded).
	\item {\bf Iterations:} Number of times to replace a randomly chosen item in the knapsack with the current item. A value of ``ALL'' implies every item in the knapsack will be replaced to find the optimal position of the current item.
	\item {\bf Items to be considered:} Number of items to be placed in the knapsack to evaluate. A value of ``ALL'' implies every item not currently contained within the knapsack will be considered.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Obsessive Packing}
For each instance, the algorithms mentioned in the table below were run 20 times and the result was obtained. In addition the execution time for the entire 20 runs was recorded. The timer was independent of the Java classes and hence the minor fluctuations above the allocated 600 seconds (10 minutes) are due to the set-up and deallocation of the Java instances and do not imply a longer execution time of the algorithm.

\section{Conclusion}
The results shown in the previous section show that the Obsessive Packing algorithm can consistently obtain values equal to or higher then that of the \textit{Hill Climber} algorithm. Due to its intrinsic design, smaller data sets take slightly longer (apart from a280\_n279). However as the instances grow larger,  the Obsessive Packing algorithm obtains a better result within the allocated time and if left running past the 10 minute limit, would also complete sooner than the \textit{Hill Climber} algorithm.\\

The Obsessive Packing algorithm could be improved by considering changes to the TSP tour. Instances {\bf a280\_n1395} and {\bf a280\_n2790} appear to reach the optimal knapsack packing for the supplied tour, hence implying that modifying the TSP tour based on the knapsack may in-fact yield better results.
